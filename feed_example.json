Saint\nJohn was head of Global Consumer Marketing for Apple Music (and\npredecessor Beats Music). [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>While Apple has several women of color in higher-ranking\npositions, Saint John had a high profile beyond Apple and was\nwidely praised for her on-stage work last year. She was also\nfairly unique among Apple executives in maintaining a strong\npersonal brand beyond her work identity, with a strong following\non Instagram and Twitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So much for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2017/05/27/ep-191\">my prediction on The Talk Show</a> that we&#8217;d see Boz on-stage again in the WWDC keynote.
